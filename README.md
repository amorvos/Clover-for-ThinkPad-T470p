# Clover-for-ThinkPad-T470p
Mac os 10.14 Mojave clover for T470p

EM7455 wWan card works well (not tested, please give me feedback. The driver is modified based on the cellphonehelper.kext, and make sure the COM port #8 of Sierra EM7455 is enabled)

backlight and hidpi (using the onekeyhidpi script with is attached in the folder)are enabled, backlight can be adjusted by the function key, same to in Windows.

sound card (sound input & output) works well with ALC & Lilu driver

battery percentage can be displayed with the suitable DSDT

Trim is enabled

Touchpad can work with three-finger gesture

The onekey hidpi comes from ZeRo Xu @xzhiih https://github.com/xzhih/one-key-hidpi?files=1


Suggest:
install DW1830 (dell wireless BCM wirless) to use wifi and Bluetooth. the driver for working in Windows need to be downloaded in Dell support site.

This thinkpad t470p is:
i7-7700HQ
512GB intel 760p (Samsung PM981 cannot work in Mac OS, the only way is to change the hard drive)
32GB DDR4 RAM (Kingston HyperX)
2560*1440 WQHD display (Use one-key-hidpi to enable retina and I suggest to use the value "1600 x 900")

known issues:
the HDMI ouput and mini displayport output can not work

If you have any idea, please write feedback to me.
